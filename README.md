An iOS and Android application developed using the React Native platform. 
This application displays a list of popular albums by artist, allowing users to click on 
the albums and visit the Amazon website to purchase and view the album all inside the app.

Currently working on adding more features to the application such as 
integrating the Free Music Archive API and 
allowing users to utilize the app to listen/download free music from FMA within the application.

To test out the application, extract the contents of the zip file, then open your terminal, change to the project directory, and:

```
> cd [app directory]
> react-native run-ios
```
